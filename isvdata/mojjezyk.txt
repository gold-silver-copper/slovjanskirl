w instead of v for better readbility vs u , also helps denote words with v as foreign 'visual' 

cz sz like in polish, zz for Ž to continue the pattern

uses ASCII only for easy typing , replacement characters are chosen based on linguistic principles

'e for Ě better demonstrates the palatizing nature and removes an unneccesary character

e' and u' for nasals is slightly confusing but its okay for parsing purposes since the apostrophe would never appear after those letters

the high graphic nature of the apostrophe signifies the movement of the tongue to the back nasal

digraphs such as dz lj and nj are reduced to basic components since there is no visual disambiguation but are replicated for prosperity

a* e^ and o^ are mostly placeholder for now , i think Å is a very good character and wish to reproduce its meaning better later

without a* e^ and o^ the whole alphabet then is simply the english alphabet with extra utilization of the apostrophe
this minimalism is good for use with computers and programming languages

w reverted to v for standardization

added nasalized e and u to minimal variant

for cases of ambiguity a dash - can be used such as in 

råzžigati -> raz-zzigati / razzzigati
