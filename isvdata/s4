slavic languages are among the tiny minority of languages that still remain in the universe in the 33rd millenium. much can be said about their history
but the current variation exists in a form unlike any of the past. it is derived from a pan slavic language that was at one point called interslavic
it changed in many ways, adopting the vocabulary of every slavic language it encountered in a very open policy designed to absorb all other slavic languages
the grammar was standardized and simplified substantially, so was the orthography, to make it more suitable for computing
thus the language was more fit for computers than for humans some say, but this brought with it great technological advances for all the slavs involved
ancient computer standards became religious law, and the character set known as ASCII was revered for its perfection, over the heathenry of unicode

due to the popularity of english (angliski, angelsky) and high gothic latin , many learned borrowings entered the language from these two directly, replacing the
previous greco roman borrowed variants

due to the status of slavic as a language not as much utilized as angelsky , there are many orthographies with little standardization, 
altho etymological dictionaries exist
