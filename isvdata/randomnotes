character is created and those things are saved as a character creation data object
, that is attached to the entity., then the entity is given an id, and an inventory, a health component, position,

world is a struct that is say 100 x 100 and containts elements which are chunks. these chunks contain a rng seed
for generating the base terrain, they also contain the diffs which will be player or entity affected .
maybe they will contain biome information as well? maybe they can also be tagged with containing a world structure
whose information will be prefabd, or contain rng for a structure, or use the existing rng for it...

trees can be cut down with an axe. a tree gives X logs, Y branches/stick, Z leaves, roots,
so each of these logs,branches, etc will be tagged as being that type of tree
apple trees give apple tree logs, apple tree stick, apple tree seeds,

terrain... a tile can have a terrain, a furniture, and an entity. terrain should have both a ground component, a ground covering component, and then furntire
because you need dirt on the bottom, then grass on top, then a fence post or a table.

grass can be harvested with any cutting instrument like knife or sickle and gives seeds . but only when it is ready, so have growth cycles
same with bushes but they provide vines or berries
have saplings for trees i guess

you fell a tree, then u have a fallen tree. a fallen tree u can then obrabotati, to get its branches, bark, and timber. a tree will have a size like 5
and that is how many times u can harvest a fallen tree for a set amount of branches bark and timber each time, 

the more u use a single item the more ur affinity towards that item
grows and thats the only way to gain skill is to stay with one item?
players will be so mad if they lose an item
no skills...



the menu should have the following buttons: 


single player , multi player  , quit 

single - launches u into a game

multi - show connect screen - ip, user , pass  - then sync

quit-quit
